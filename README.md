A set of interfaces & classes for creating domain driven projects.

# What is it?

Axiom is a set of PHP interfaces and classes designed to help you flesh out domain driven projects faster. Your project doesn't even necessarily need to be domain driven either; any project that requires a good scalable & maintanable code base can benifit from using the design practices implemented by Axiom. Go nuts!

# Installation

```bash
composer require enzyme/axiom
```

# Roadmap
- [ ] Finish readme/documentation.
- [ ] Generate Interface/Class references.
- [ ] Create first release candidate.
